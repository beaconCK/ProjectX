The Junior Film Fleadh
When viewed as a software environment

The Junior Film Fleadh, now in its 22nd year, runs for 4 day in November. It runs from Wednesday to Saturday. In 2016, this will be November 9th – 12th. Attendees range from 4th class in primary school up to leaving certificate at second level. It screens a selection of short and feature film, invites entries for a script pitching competition and hosts several workshops on the Saturday of the festival.

Films are screened in the Town Hall Theatre from 9.30/10am to 4/4.30p.m. Wednesday to Friday and one matinee screening takes place on Saturday. Workshops take place in several different venues.

The festival also operates an Outreach programme where various films are made available for schools. The festival will then conduct workshops where a tutor will attend a school to screen the film and teach a class of some kind on film and/or language.

Reasons for implementing software would be to streamline its data flows and allow for the smooth flow of data between all parties. Also by storing all data online it opens up the opportunity for the festival to operate an archive of the festival, and to allow for greater functionality for the public, educators and students.

There are 8 processes at work in the JFF:

•	Film submission, scheduling and exhibition
•	Workshop booking
•	Script pitching competition
•	Outreach programme scheduling and booking
•	Overall festival programming
•	Recording of attendee data for later marketing
•	Programme creation
•	Archiving

Currently the only charges associated with the festival to the public are for booking workshops.

Technical expenses may include:

•	Storage enough to hold 8-10 years of short film submissions
o	Will have more exact number in this is the coming days as we are still obtaining this years short film submissions
•	Web server bandwidth enough to host an archival database of 30 years of festival programme
•	Potentially, security enough to maintain security on an archive of these films stored online, streaming through either links on the website or through an archive platform




Film submission scheduling and exhibition (SSE)
The JFF programmes two types of film:

•	Feature film (50 mins or more)
•	Short film (30 mins or less)

Films in between are not usually created and/or programmed, this being the realm of most television dramas.

Feature film is programmed from a selection of industry contacts, including film distributors and educational content programmers (e.g. the Irish Film Institute). This process is closed to the public. Feature film is often accompanied by handouts or workbooks for students to take away. It is possible the school/group/class will watch the film again during the school day for analysis.

Short film is selected from other youth film festivals (Irish and increasingly international) and student-made films. This process is open to the public and other festivals.

Film submission follow a six stage process.

1.	Submission opens
2.	Films are submitted to the festival with a range of data captured about them
a.	Feature film is most likely to be submitted as a streaming link but may need to be uploaded
b.	Short film is uploaded to a secure location, ideally transmitted to a drive located in the festival office – this is currently done using a mish mash of platforms, including YouTube, Vimeo, MyAIrBridge, Google Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer.
c.	Ideally short filmmakers would also be asked here if the festival may keep a copy of their film for later use in an archive that would be distributed  through the festival website
3.	The programming team watch these submissions
a.	Desired feature films enter into a negotiation process and may or may not make it to the final programme
b.	The festival will pay for some or all of its feature film in the form of either:
i.	A one-off fee
ii.	A one-off fee and a % of takings from the audience ticket receipts
iii.	A % of takings from the audience ticket receipts
c.	Films are currently distributed via a streaming platform operated in house, Plex – storing files internally is the most secure way to assure filmmakers their files are safe
4.	Films are picked and ‘locked’ into the programme
5.	Unaccepted submissions are rejected and notified
6.	Accepted film (now termed exhibition film) data is collated and used to:
a.	Populate the festivals digital and print programmes
b.	Produce logistical and administrative information for festival co-ordinating team
c.	Pass technical and administrative information to festival technical staff


Workshop booking
Currently, the JFF offers potential participants the opportunity to take part in several workshops, all held on one day in venues around the city. The content of these vary every year.

1.	Workshop candidates are sought or rebooked from previous years
2.	Workshops are scheduled
a.	Ideally through a calendar interface that can be displayed alongside film scheduling
3.	Workshop booking opens to the public
4.	Workshop booking closes when class is full or it is time for the class to run

Script Pitching
The JFF operates a story/script pitching competition for students.

1.	Entrants are invited to submit a 500 word concept to the festival.
o	Entry is free.
2.	Entries are then read by a panel of judges
3.	A shortlist of finalists are picked and notified
o	Losing pitches are notified and invited to attend final
4.	The final (present on the festival calendar) takes place in front of an audience
5.	Testimonials are recorded from winning participants (there can be draws) and displayed on archive website

Outreach Programme
The JFF operates an outreach programme to schools where we arrange for a film and educational materials to be delivered to a school in order for a workshop/class to take place. These may also be accompanied with a tutor, depending on the nature of the workshop along with tutor availability and cost. This programme is usually delivered from November to February.

1.	The festival enters negotiations with film distributors and educational bodies to secure films for its Outreach programme
a.	Usually at the same time as film submission is taking place
2.	Programme information is displayed on the website alongside the public screening programme
3.	Schools and individual teachers are invited to book the outreach programme for their class/group
4.	Bookings are confirmed
5.	Workshops carried out
a.	This may involve arranging for exhibition materials to be returned from schools
Festival programming
Data from the above 4 processes is required to be collated for the purposes of scheduling, administrating and co-ordinating.

Attendee recording and marketing
This is currently done through many semi-duplicated and incomplete data sets held on individual computers. A centralised list of attendees would help future marketing of the festival.

Programme creation
Currently, data from films, workshops and the pitching competition is collected and passed to a 3rd party. This 3rd party then transforms this data into the festivals print and digital programmes.

Ideally, if data is collected to a centralised source, it would then be used to populate the digital programme. It would then also need to be made available to a 3rd party in order to produce a print programme.

Archiving
The festival currently operates no archive. A location for students and educators to consult in regard to previous years of the festival is desirable. This could be in the form of a textual, linked archive or potentially in the form of a platform that stores short film submissions and with the permission of the filmmaker, screens these to the public (or a section thereof, perhaps a Netflix environment available only to schools).
